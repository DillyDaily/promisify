## Promisify!

Remember way back when (about 1-2 weeks ago) when you made your first crud with fs? Remember how annoying it was to repeat all the same code and deal with callbacks?

Today our goal is to take the server.js file and convert the read/write file calls into separate functions that return a promise.

Doing this should allow our code to look much cleaner.
